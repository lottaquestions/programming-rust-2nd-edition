// This program borrows a mutable reference to the local variable a,
// casts it to a raw pointer of type *mut usize, and then uses the
// offset method to produce a pointer three words further along in
// memory. This happens to be where mainâ€™s return address is stored.
// The program overwrites the return address with a constant, such
// that returning from main is undefined i.e. leads to a crash
